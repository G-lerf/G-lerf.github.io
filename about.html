        <h1>Digital artist, pixel artist, concept artist, and more</h1>
        
        <p>From a young age I’ve been fascinated with anything art-related. Drawing, 3D modeling, videogames, mosaics, ceramics. I explored everything I could and found myself inmersed with art my whole life.</p>
        
        <p>I aspire to create, to make art and to inspire others as much as art has inspired me. My love with art has centered into three “main” groups nowadays, chibis, pixel art and concept art, but I still love to explore my style inside of these three main groups.</p>
        
        <p>Do you have something you’d like created? Let’s create together.</p>
